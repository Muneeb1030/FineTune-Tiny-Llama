The connected vehicles are an important component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) in which vehicles communicate with each other and with communications infrastructure to exchange safety messages and other critical information (e.g., traf\ufb01c and road conditions). One of the main driving force for CAVs is the advancement of machine learning (ML) methods, particularly deep learning (DL), that are used for decision making at different levels. Unlike conventional connected vehicles, the autonomous (self-driving) vehicles have two important characteristics; namely, automation capability and cooperation (connectivity). In future smart cities, CAVs are expected to have a profound impact on the vehicular ecosystem and society."

In a Sybil attack, a malicious vehicle pretends many fake identities and in an impersonation attack, the adversary exploits a legitimate vehicle to obtain network access and performs malicious activities. For example, a malicious vehicle can impersonate a few non-malicious vehicles to broadcast falsi\ufb01ed messages. This type of attack is also known as the masquerading attack."

Moreover, to prevent replay attacks, a timestamp-based random number (nonce) can be embedded within messages.

A similar contribution was made by Lowd et al. in 2005 where they proposed adversarial classi\ufb01er reverse engineering technique for constructing an adversarial attack on classi\ufb01cation problems. In 2006, Barreno et al. discussed the security of ML in adversarial environments and provided a taxonomy of attacks on ML schemes along with the potential defenses against them. In 2010, Huang et al. provided the \ufb01rst consolidated review of adversarial ML where they discussed the limitations on the classi\ufb01ers and adversaries in real-world settings.

Another gradient-based attack was proposed by Goodfellow et al.. In this attack, they formulated adversarial ML as a min-max problem and adversarial examples were produced by calculating the lower bound on the adversarial perturbations.

Defensive distillation is a training method in which a model is trained to predict the classi\ufb01cation probabilities of another model which was trained on the baseline standard to give more importance to accuracy. Papernot et al. also proposed a black-box adversarial ML attack where they exploited the transferability property of adversarial examples to fool the ML/DL classi\ufb01ers. This black-box adversarial attack was based on the substitute model training which not only fools the ML/DL classi\ufb01ers but also breaks the distillation defensive mechanism. Carlini et al. proposed a suite of three adversarial attacks termed as C&W attacks on DNNs by exploiting three distinct distance measures L1, L2, and L\u221e. These attacks have not only evaded the DNN classi\ufb01ers but also evaded the defensive distillation successfully. This demonstrated that defensive distillation is not an appropriate method for building robustness. In another paper, Carlini et al. presented that the proposed adversarial attacks inhave successfully evaded the ten well known defensive schemes against adversarial examples. Right now these attacks are also considered as state-of-art adversarial ML attacks. Furthermore, Carlini et al. successfully demonstrated an adversarial attack on speech recognition system by adding small noise in the audio signal that forces the underlying ML model to generate intended commands/text.

Robustifying ML Models Against Distribution Drifts To restrict the integrity attacks, ML models should be made robust against distribution drifts which refer to the situation where train and test data distributions are different. This difference between the training and test distributions gives rise to adversarial examples. These examples can also be considered as the worst case distribution drifts. It is fairly clear that the data collection process in the vehicular ecosystem is temporal and dynamic in nature so such distribution drifts are highly possible and will affect the robustness of the underlying ML systems. Moreover, such drifts can be exploited by the adversaries to create adversarial samples during inference, for example, in authors investigated this distribution drift by introducing positively connotated words in spam emails to evade detection. Moreover, modi\ufb01cation of the training distribution is also possible in a similar way and distribution drift violates the widely known presumption that we can achieve low learning error when a large training data is available. Ford at al. have presented empirical and theoretical evidence that adversarial examples are a consequence of test error in noise caused by a distributional shift in the data. To ensure that the adversarial defense is trustworthy, it must provide defense against data distribution shifts. As the perception system of CAVs is mainly based on data-driven modeling using historical training data, it is highly susceptible to the problem of distribution drifts. Therefore, robustifying ML models against the aforementioned distribution drifts is very important. One way to counter this problem is to leverage deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for developing 24 the perception system of autonomous vehicles but this is not yet practically possible, as the state and action spaces in realistic settings (road and vehicular environment) are continuous and very complex. Therefore, \ufb01ne control is required for the ef\ufb01cacy of the system. However, the work on leveraging deep RL-based methods for autonomous vehicles is building up. For instance, Sallab et al. proposed a deep RLbased framework for autonomous vehicles that enables the vehicle to handle partially observable scenarios. They investigated the effectiveness of their system using an open source 3D car racing simulator (TORCS8) and demonstrated that their model was able to learn complex road curvatures and simple inter-vehicle interactions. On the counter side, deep RL-based systems have been shown vulnerable to policy induction attacks."

CONCLUSIONS The recent discoveries that machine learning (ML) techniques are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations have raised questions on the security of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), which utilize ML techniques for various tasks ranging from environmental perception to objection recognition and movement prediction.

In this work, we present for the \ufb01rst time a comprehensive analysis of the challenges posed by adversarial ML attacks for CAVs aggregating insights from both the ML and CAV literature. Our major contributions include: a broad description of the ML pipeline used in CAVs; description of the various adversarial attacks that can be launched on the various components of the CAV ML pipeline; a detailed taxonomy of the adversarial ML threat for CAVs; a comprehensive survey of adversarial ML attacks and defenses proposed in literature. Finally, open research challenges and future directions are discussed to provide readers with the opportunity to develop robust and ef\ufb01cient solutions for the application of ML models in CAVs."

But such a hypothesis fails to explain the transferability1 of adversarial examples from one ML model to another. In addition, it is not only the nonlinear DNN models that suffer from these attacks, but linear models have also been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples.

Developing New Metrics for ML in Cognitive Networks Traditionally, the metric used to evaluate the performance of an ML model nearly always has been a variant of the metric of prediction accuracy\u2014i.e., how often is the model correct in its prediction or classi\ufb01cation? To be sure accuracy can be measured in various ways (such as precision, speci\ufb01city, sensitivity, recall), but using accuracy alone as a metric can only inform us of the average-case performance. This has the implicit assumption that the distribution of the test data will be similar to the distribution of the training data. This assumption obviously fails to hold when an adversary intentionally changes the test data with the explicit goal of defeating the ML model. There is, therefore, a need to also focus on evaluating a system\u2019s worstcase performance and measure the adversarial resilience of the ML model. We should move away from only using traditional ML metrics related to accuracy and precision towards a greater emphasis on robustness, transparency, and resilience. Here we recommend some new metrics for ensuring the appropriate application and validation of ML schemes in self-driving cognitive networking. There can be more metrics depending upon the design of ML-based self-driving cognitive networking application."

In order to perform these tasks, the network must have the ability to interact and adapt according to network conditions. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides the ability to interact, learn, and adapt to the ever-changing network conditions and it is expected to be heavily utilized in future self-driving cognitive networks. Unfortunately, DRL also lacks robustness against adversarial examples and it has been recently shown that adversarial examples can affect the performance of DRL.

The development of effective defenses against adversarial ML attacks, even though tough, is not impossible since attackers are often constrained in how effectively they can attack a model and there has been some positive progress on this front.

Data collection and public datasets: Collecting air quality data is a difficult process since varying concentrations of air contaminants are involved. Given the environmental and health dangers associated with poor urban air quality, it is critical to creating a centralized real-time air quality data monitoring and processing system. Sensor-centric data collection and crowd-centric data collection are two approaches for obtaining urban data (e.g., air quality data, POI, meteorological data, etc.). There are two types of sensor-centric paradigms. These classifications are based on whether the sensors gathering data are mobile (deployed on a moving item) or static (deployed on a fixed location). There are two types of crowd-sourced data collection: active (data created through participation surveys and check-ins) and passive (data generated by users passively while using the urban infrastructure).

This data stationarity is not valid for most of the real world cases and the void created by following this assumption is exploited by the adversary for crafting the adversarial examples. Secondly, most of the ML schemes are based on the empirical risk minimization (ERM), which is an approximation of the actual unknown probability distribution. The ERM has an associated error with it which can be exploited by the adversary to make an adversarial example."

The larger and smaller models are called the teacher and student models respectively.

While there are now multiple methods of distillation algorithms we selected the 5 response-based algorithm. As shown in Figure 3, the hypothesis is that the student model will learn to mimic the predictions of the teacher model.

However, the inability of these CNN-based methodologies to encapsulate the sequential essence of speech data was a substantial disadvantage. This shortcoming led to the inception of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) architectures, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), specifically engineered for handling sequential data. RNNs proved to be a suitable fit for sequential data given their ability to process extensive sequences incrementally, maintaining a constrained memory of preceding sequence components. A recent trend in research merges the unique strengths of both CNNs and RNNs. This involves using CNNs to derive audio features, which are then fed as input for RNN training.

Techniques to mitigate data contamination\u2014like data cleaning, augmentation, and validation\u2014are critical research areas for Large Audio Models. The leaderboard is a technique used to control inherited data contamination by providing details of the ancestor models and weights used for training a new LLM model. Jacovi et al. proposed three strategies for mitigating data contamination issues in LLMs. Their first strategy involves encrypting test data with a public key and licensing it to control the distribution of derivatives of the test data. The second strategy is conditioning the access of the API by demanding the API holders not to train on the test data. Lastly, the third strategy involves releasing the contextual information of data sourced from the internet to circumvent data contamination arising from instances with online solutions, such as repeated conversations, question-answer pairs, emojis, articles, and their synthesised variations. To the best of our knowledge, the techniques that ensure robustness against determined contamination actors and prompts are limited in their performance.

Since BD4D is directly related to human development the big data based AI model used in these cases (i.e. healthcare system, judicial system etc.) must ensure high accuracy and interpretability. A possible remedy is to insist on using interpretable ML for high-stakes BD4D decisions and to utilize explanation methods for justifying the decisions, where explanation means the provision of visual or textual evidence of a certain features relation to AI models decision. As an example work in this space, Bach et al. proposed layer-wise relevance propagation method (LRP) which provides a visual contribution of each input feature in decision making. In another work, Ribeiro et al. proposed two explanation methods namely locally interpretable model-agnostics (LIME) and submodular pick locally interpretable model-agnostics (SP-LIME).

In a study of 1000 major business investments conducted by McKinsey, it was found that when organizations worked to minimize the biases in their decision-making, they achieved up to 7% higher returns. The biases associated with multiple comparisons can be deliberately avoided using techniques such as the Bonferroni correction, the Sidak correction, and the HolmBonferroni correction. Another source of bias is called data snooping or data dredging, which occurs when a portion of data is used more than once for model selection or inference. In technical evaluations of results, it is conceivable to repeat experiments using the same dataset to get satisfactory results. Data dredging can be avoided by conducting randomized out-of-sample experiments during hypotheses building. For example, an analyst gathers a dataset and arbitrarily segments it into two subsets, A and B. Initially, only one subset\u2014say, subset A\u2014is analyzed for constructing hypotheses.

For this purpose, a two-stream network is proposed consisting of a spatial stream and a frequency stream. The proposed method generalizes to unseen fake image generator distributions much better than the current state-of-theart approaches. The proposed method is also found to be more robust to the common image perturbations including blur and JPEG compression artifacts. The improved performance is leveraged by combining two types of frequency domain transformations, namely, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Both transformations are applied upon YCbCr color-space and different frequency domain channels are concatenated to discriminate fake images from the real ones. By exploiting the differences between the real and the fake image frequency responses, improved fake detection performance is achieved. In the future, we aim to extend this work for fake video and audio detection."

In practice, detection of such activity is manually intensive and costly, taking days and weeks after the jammer activation to detect it. We present a novel data-driven jammer detection framework termed JADE that leverages continually collected operator-side cell-level KPIs to automate this process. As part of this framework, we develop two deep learning based semi-supervised anomaly detection methods tailored for the jammer detection use case. JADE features further innovations, including an adaptive thresholding mechanism and transfer learning based training to efficiently scale JADE for operation in real-world mobile networks. Using a real-world 4G RAN dataset from a multinational mobile network operator, we demonstrate the efficacy of proposed jammer detection methods relative to commonly used anomaly detection methods. We also demonstrate the robustness of our proposed methods in accurately detecting jammer activity across multiple frequency bands and diverse types of jammers. We present real-world validation results from applying our methods in the operator\u2019s network for online jammer detection.

Moreover, the JADE framework utilizes transfer learning to enable itself to scalably work across many cells and multiple frequency bands. We have evaluated the JADE framework on a 4G RAN dataset provided by a multinational mobile network operator with jammer activation events labeled for different types of jammers. Field validation is also conducted, and it shows the effectiveness of the JADE framework in the wild.

These advanced learning techniques have produced effective and ef\ufb01cient results in AER and automated the whole process. AER systems are used in the commercial market for understanding user engagement, sentiment analysis, attention tracking, behaviour understanding, etc. However, these AER systems are also prone to shortcomings and biases in the training and testing data. The literature on the shortcomings of traditional and deep ML techniques suggests that data and algorithmic biases can impact the performance of these learning techniques. AER systems are developed using data acquired from humans, and human biases are likely to be translated into the learning process, impairing AER system judgements.

Automated physiognomy refers to the use of AI models to identify a person\u2019s gender, emotional state, level of intellect, and other characteristics from only one photograph of them. Engelmann et al. debated the fairness and ethical concerns of automated physiognomy with a comprehensive experiment in which thousands of non-AI individuals were invited to respond on what AI should ethically infer from faces. The questions also include the number of characteristics inferred from faces by well-known AI models (including AER models), such as gender, emotional expression, likeability, assertiveness, intellect, colour, trustworthiness, and use of spectacles. Because all these characteristics are subjective, participants were asked to provide a Likert scale score and a written explanation of why a particular score was awarded for two speci\ufb01c use cases: advertising and hiring.

Interestingly, the lifetime of a message containing misinformation is quite high, for both text (7 hrs) and images (5.5 hrs), especially compared to the Information category. This means that misinformation tends to persist longer compared to information, which supports existing studies showing similar results.

Our work is unique as this is the \ufb01rst work to not only study misinformation trends on WhatsApp but also \ufb01nd a relation between WhatsApp and Twitter. Our analyses showed that while it is true that the majority of shared information is not misinformation, misinformation seems to have a longer lifespan on WhatsApp compared to other types of COVID messages (the lifetime of misinformation is roughly 4 times that of correct information). On Twitter the inverse was seen, as COVID misinformation tended to disappear from Twitter 3 times faster than information. This can potentially be attributed to the open nature of Twitter, and how a vast number of users can publicly negate such tweets. While observing user behavior, we found 8 images that could be attributed to organized disinformation, other than that, we did not \ufb01nd any evidence of disinformation within images."

The gNB connects to the MEC to signi\ufb01cantly reduce the network latency for selected applications by availing edge server computing at the MEC cloud which is close to the radio service cells. For instance, to cater to the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) use-case of industry automation, the RAN radio unit along with the DU, CU, and the MEC can be installed onsite. Thus, 5G network architecture enables applications to be deployed remotely (App 3 and App 4) or near the edge (App 1 and App 2) where low latency is a requirement."

SpectraGAN is an original conditional GAN design with the defining feature of generating spectra of mobile traffic at all locations of the target region based on their contextual features. Evaluations with mobile traffic measurement datasets collected by different operators in 13 cities across two European countries demonstrate that SpectraGAN can synthesize more dependable traffic than a range of representative baselines from the literature.

Thirdly, as cities have diverse geographical span, the model should be capable of generating traffic over arbitrary spatial dimensions.

We can easily generate arbitrary length signal using G\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udf03by recurrently running a RNN for the desired number of time-steps within each patch4. Doing the same is not as straightforward for G\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udf03, which outputs fixedlength frequency components. These components are essentially a discretization of the underlying continuous frequency distribution; the latter is needed to generate time series of any given length. We therefore perform an approximation in the frequency domain in order to generate longer time series. More concretely, since the duration of the time signal obtained via IFFT is linearly proportional to the number of frequency components \ud835\udc39, we can act on the latter to obtain a time series with target duration \ud835\udc47\u2032. Specifically, for a frequency vector f of length \ud835\udc39, we first expand f to a desired length \ud835\udc39\u2032 = \ud835\udc47\u2032/2 + 1. If \ud835\udc39\u2032 is a \ud835\udc58-multiple of \ud835\udc39, our approximation initializes the newly expanded vector, f\u2032, with zeroes and then fills every \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61\u210elocation in this vector using values from the old one (f), scaled by \ud835\udc58(so that the total energy is \ud835\udc58times); see Figure 4 for an example with \ud835\udc58= 2. This procedure gives f\u2032 with the desired length \ud835\udc39\u2032 and ensures the total energy is also correctly multiplied; 4We omit the spatial index in this paragraph as it refers to a single patch."

While these methods share a similar high-level goal we target, they are not well suited for mobile network traffic generation. Reasons include that such previous approaches are limited to the estimation of a few future frames, are conditioned on previous frames, capture only short-term temporal correlations, and can be only conditioned on non-spatial contexts such as weather or weekdays/weekends. In contrast, SpectraGAN is designed to model spatiotemporal relations over long periods of time, and to condition the generated data on spatial contexts.

This massive transition and new networking regimes have got research community to think of new alternative networking designs for wireless and data communication. In this section, we will brie\ufb02y introduce and discuss the issues in previous and current networking architecture. We will also provide a list of problems in current networking architecture. This section will also include the social and economic challenges for next generation networking architecture."

The major shortcoming of this design was the lack of the operational information dissemination to other layers, which is a major hindrance in ful\ufb01lling the necessary architectural design requirements of wireless communication system. Another reason for this failure was the time-varying nature of the wireless channel. To overcome these issues a cross-layer designing approach for wireless network was used, where joint optimization of networking protocols across different layers and improved coordination among different layers was introduced. Fundamentally, cross-layer wireless network architectures are based on sharing the knowledge of physical and media access control (MAC) layer of the wireless channel with the layers above them. This information sharing solves the critical problem of resource allocation in wireless networking. The major problem with this design approach is its lack of dynamic behavior adaption of the wireless network (user diversity and different QoS demands of users) and this lack of adaption has a negative effect on the tradeoff between performance and interoperability."

This issue is known as spectrum access and utilization. The electromagnetic spectrum is a scarce natural resource, regulated by governments. The expected exponential growth in connected devices and proposed small densely connected topologies for upcoming communication systems, will have a disruptive effect on spectrum allocation and utilization. Similarly, rapid growth in the adaption of new communication technologies and reduced cost of access, for personal and corporate use has raised serious questions about the availability and utilization of electromagnetic spectrum. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) published a report in 2002, which is considered to be a very \ufb01rst document reviewing the 90 years of spectrum allocation and usage. This report characterized the potential issues in electromagnetic spectrum allocation and usage. Utilization of electromagnetic spectrum is biased in terms of occupancy of frequency bands in the spectrum when we sweep the whole frequency spectrum, few frequency bands are vacant most of the time, few are partially loaded and rest of them are heavily loaded. This uneven distribution of frequency bands usage causes under-utilization of the electromagnetic spectrum."

This sensing, reasoning and adapting behavior is known as cognitive behavior. By incorporating cognitive behavior, Mitola et al., in the year 2000 purposed a new paradigm of intelligent wireless communication systems called cognitive radios, which has the ability of sensing the statistical changes in incoming radio frequency signals and making corresponding changes in certain network operating parameters.

Governments and social media giants are trying to deal with this issue but unfortunately, there hasn\u2019t been any notable success. Extremism is a subjective term; identifying and quantifying it is an open area of research because of its connections with various cultural, religious, political, and technological aspects. Extremist content is an amalgamation of fake news, misinterpreted religious literature, mis/dis-information, out-of-context video/audio clips, hateful blogs, search engine optimized hashtags, propaganda videos/literature, deepfakes, and abuse. All online extremist ideas begin in the offline world (schools, theological seminaries, literature, ideas of revenge and supremacy, etc.), and the butterfly effect of social media and content optimization algorithms makes it viral. This availability and virality of extremist content increase online extremism and, in many cases into real-world extremism episodes. Identifying and moderating social media content while preserving free speech and privacy is a challenging task. Solving this problem requires content moderation techniques and platform-level policies. The lack of an extremism detection and prevention framework, notably in India and Pakistan, is leading in the continual distribution of extremist content via social media apps. This work outlines a framework for extremist content identification and mitigation.

OTDR is a valuable technique for characterizing losses and locating faults in fiber communication links. OTDR testing is the most common method available for determining the exact location of break in an installed fiber optic cable when the cable jacket is not visibly damaged. OTDRs are used to measure a fiber\u2019s length, end-toend loss, location of optical loss and reflectivity of components along the fiber. OTDR works on the principle of Rayleigh backscattering. The basic idea lies in transmitting a short pulse of light through a fiber and examining the time dependent response of the resulting backscattered signal."

OTDR measures the backscatter light as a function of time from the initial pulse injection.

Variety of techniques has been used to detect such weak signals. A composite coding scheme for SNR enhancement has been used for such weak signal detection and tested for our in-house built OTDR. The notion lies in combining complementary correlation codes with the simplex codes to achieve higher gain than conventional coding techniques."

II. EXISTING EVENT DETECTION TECHNIQUES Three distinct techniques exist which are useful for the post processing of OTDR output data. A. Least Square Approximation Least square approximation is the most famous method used in post processing algorithms for OTDRs. Best line fit is calculated for noisy data which ensures minimum mean square error (MMSE). Then it is subjected to threshold detection, sharp changes in the backscatter data are identified and extracted. A general rule with least square approximation is that an event\u2019s magnitude should be at least double the magnitude of noise to be accurately located. If data is very noisy the line fitted to the data may not represent the true slope and would produce inaccurate results. The accuracy of processing is difficult to ensure in acquired low SNR data. B. Wavelet Analysis Wavelet analysis method is used for finding discontinuities in the OTDR signature\u2019s data. Curve data is subjected to wavelet transform and the coefficients are subjected to a threshold value filter to extract the high frequency information, as sharp changes lies in the high frequency portion. Denoising is performed and finally the positions of the sharp changes are located by using Maximum Mold Algorithm. The whole process is summarized in the figure 2."

Property (a) is applied for estimating attenuation parameters and property (b) is used to identify end of fiber. A binary detection criterion is established based on phase of WT of the OTDR data to detect events. Morlet\u2019s complex wavelet transform approach faces difficulties in limited operation time and uncertainty in detected events. C. Wave-Shape Analysis Wave-Shape analysis is the most advanced approach in OTDR event detection algorithms. Wave shape analysis algorithm is the highly sophisticated method of data processing that accurately locates the events in the data based on inflection points in the data. Previously discussed algorithm can give inappropriate events or even miss some events. Wave shape algorithm has the capacity to overcome these shortcomings. Wave shape algorithm can accurately locate and measure events having magnitude one half of the magnitude of the noise in the data. This improvement in performance is achieved by analyzing the curve shape of whole data. This technique produces superior amplitude measurements of the event. Wave shape analysis is the proprietary algorithm of \u201cNetTek OTDR\u201d. III. VECTOR INDEXING ALGORITHM The proposed algorithm works on vector index matching. Fiber response consist of two parameters namely Distance and Backscatter power which are plotted on x-axis and y-axis simultaneously. The response out of OTDR board will be discrete in nature and looks like exponentially decaying signal as shown in Fig.1. The events in the signature curve are abrupt changes in the consecutive recorded values. First OTDR curve data is stored in two separate vectors, distance vector and backscatter vector simultaneously. Since the sudden changes in information exist in the backscatter vector the numerical difference operation is applied on it prior to threshold detection. Values crossing the threshold limit are events and cardinality of each event is mapped on the distance vector to find corresponding distance of the event. Meanwhile, the value of sample before the event and the value after the event are gathered and linear interpolation is performed to find the exact sample that crosses the threshold. This helps to improve the efficiency and accuracy in terms of distance measurement. The computational complexity is reduced and the spatial resolution capability of event detection improves.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In this section the experimental results are discussed which are gathered by employing proposed post processing algorithm to the OTDR data from live optical fibers of 100km each named as fiber under test FUT-1 and FUT-2. Once the signatures are acquired and converted into the final presentable form by performing filtering, averaging, correlation and logarithmic operations, they need to be analyzed for events. Since the logarithmic operation is sensitive to any fixed/DC offset that may have been added to the OTDR signal. The source of such offset is usually the ADC. All ADC\u2019s have some inherent offset value. If the offset is not removed properly the logged trace rolls up or down when the backscatter reaches the noise floor level.

The sudden change due to reflective event is followed by a return of the Rayleigh backscatter to its nominal value. For reflective events the reflectance threshold is set by the OTDR user at the start of testing. Events having threshold less than the specified threshold are not identified. Non-reflective events are identified by subjecting the numerical difference values to the lower loss threshold. End of fiber (EOF) is identified by using EOF threshold depending upon the user defined input parameters at the start of testing. Detection thus remains dependent on the threshold definition for different types of events. VII. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have focused our work on the post processing algorithm for event detection and feature extraction from acquired OTDR traces. By using numerical difference operation combined with vector index matching, improvement in event detection, feature extraction and spatial resolution has been achieved. The performance results on experimental setup indicate that the implementation of the vector indexing algorithm shall allow accurate event detection and classification. Hence the proposed vector indexing algorithm provides an effective solution for event detection in optical time domain reflectometers."

It is anticipated that AI and ML will also make a similar impact on the networking ecosystem and will help realize a future vision of cognitive networks,, in which networks will self-organize and will autonomously implement intelligent network-wide behavior to solve problems such as routing, scheduling, resource allocation, and anomaly detection. The initial attempts towards creating cognitive or intelligent networks have relied mostly on supervised ML methods, which are ef\ufb01cient and powerful but are limited in scope by their need for labeled data. With network data becoming increasingly voluminous (with a disproportionate rise in unstructured unlabeled data), there is a groundswell of interest in leveraging unsupervised ML methods to utilize unlabeled data, in addition to labeled data where available, to optimize network performance. The rising interest in applying unsupervised ML in networking applications also stems from the need to liberate ML applications from restrictive demands of supervised ML. Another reason of employing unsupervised ML in networking is the expensiveness of curating labeled network data at scale, since labeled data may be unavailable and manual annotation is prohibitively inconvenient, in addition, to be outdated quickly (due to the highly dynamic nature of computer networks)."

As pointed out in, understandability of the semantics of the decisions made by ML is especially important for the operational success of ML in large-scale operational networks and its acceptance by operators, network managers, and users. But prediction accuracy and simplicity are often in con\ufb02ict. As an example, the greater accuracy of NNs accrues from its complex nature in which input variables are combined in a nonlinear fashion to build a complicated hard-to-explain model; with NNs it may not be possible to get interpretability as well since they make a tradeoff in which they sacri\ufb01ce interpretability to achieve high accuracy. There are various ongoing research efforts that are focused on making techniques such as NNs less opaque. Apart from the focus on NNs, there is a general interest in making AI and ML more explainable and interpretable\u2014e.g., the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA\u2019s explainable AI project2 is aiming to develop explainable AI models (leveraging various design options spanning the performance-vs-explainability tradeoff space) that can explain the rationale of their decisionmaking so that users are able to appropriately trust these models particularly for new envisioned control applications in which optimization decisions are made autonomously by algorithms."

According to the Occam Razor principle, the model complexity should be commensurate with the amount of data available, and with overly complex models, the ability to predict and generalize diminishes. Two major reasons for over\ufb01tting could be the overly large size of the learning model and fewer sample data used for training purposes.

In supervised learning, training data along with the corresponding labels are available for decision making. Supervised learning is by far the most wellstudied branch of ML for problems with labeled data, which has a lot of applications in practice such as object recognition, speech recognition, spam detection, pattern recognition, and many more.

To ensure the imperceptibility of the perturbation, the amplitude of the adversarial examples crafting algorithms (Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Jacobianbased Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) ) is controlled. The attack procedure is divided into two phases, initialization and exploitation. The initialization phase includes the training of a DQN on adversarial reward function to generate an adversarial policy. Then, a replica of the target\u2019s DQN is created and initialized from random parameters. The exploitation phase includes generating adversarial inputs such that the target DQN can be made to follow actions governed by the adversarial policy. Furthermore, they propose an attack method to manipulate the policy of the DQN by exploiting the transferability of adversarial samples. They use a black-box setting and show a success rate of 70% when adversarial examples are transferred from one model to another. The cycle of the proposed policy induction attack is shown in Figure 6.

An ensemble of qvalue networks is used to model risk as to the variance of value functions.

They test their approach on a self-driving environment using the TORCS simulator and show that a risk-averse agent handles the risk better and leads to fewer crashes than a normal agent trained in a similar environment. The attacker and the victim agent are made to work independently in the same environment. This gives more options to the attacker to perturb the environment hence serving as a strong adversary."

System dynamics research has consistently highlighted the counterintuitive nature of complex social systems in that the high-leverage points are not where most people expect, and if even these points are identified, they are prone to be altered in the wrong direction by people. In an influential essay on leverage, Donella Meadows stated that interventions that rely only on parameter optimization are typically low leverage, and higher leverage can be attained through deeper interventions that for example optimize information flows (e.g., by minimizing information sharing delays) or change the system rules (i.e., the incentives and the constraints); the most powerful way to change a system, Meadows notes is to change the system goals and paradigm, out of which its goals, rules, and culture emerge.

We performed a series of experiments to show the effectiveness of ChatGPT for data annotation. However, we observed that annotations solely based on text lacked generalisation to speech emotion data due to the absence of audio context. To address this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that incorporates audio features such as average energy, pitch, and gender information to provide essential audio context for accurate sample annotation. Furthermore, we introduce a method for encoding speech into a fixedlength discrete feature representation using a Vector Quantised Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), which serves as the audio context in the annotation prompt. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first endeavour to leverage LLMs for annotating speech emotion data, specifically for classification purposes, and evaluating their performance. We conduct a comparative analysis between LLM-based data annotations and human data annotations using publicly available datasets, including IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV."

Semi-supervised annotations combine the benefits of human-expert annotations with bulk annotations for data annotation, but they are complex to implement and have generalisability and robustness difficulties.

Let us denote the output from the encoder as ze. The vector quantiser component contains an embedding space with k total vectors each with dimension d. The main goal of this component is to output a series of embedding vectors that we call zq. To accomplish this, we first reshape ze in the form of (n \u2217h \u2217w, d) and calculate the distance for each of these vectors with the vectors in the embedding dictionary. For each of the n \u2217h \u2217w vectors, we find the closest of the k vectors from the embedding space and index the closest vector from the embedding space for each n \u2217h \u2217w vector. The discrete indices of each of the vectors in the embedding space are called codes, and we get a unique series of codes for each input to the model. The selected vectors are then reshaped back to match the shape of ze. Finally, the reshaped vector embeddings are passed through a series of transpose convolutions to reconstruct the original input Mel-spectrogram. One problem with this approach is that the process of selecting vectors is not differentiable. To tackle this problem, the authors simply copy the gradients from zq to ze."

To validate this concept, we select the MELD dataset, which consists of dialogue samples from the Friends TV series. We employ the few-shot approach, using samples from the IEMOCAP dataset for few-shots, and annotate the MELD data with four emotions: happy, anger, neutral, and sad.

By using our proposed algorithm LoRaDRL, we can use the basic ALOHA to perform similar to complex MAC protocols. In this subsection, we test the performance of our proposed algorithm LoRaDRL with multiple MAC protocols. We consider a 2-channel LoRa network containing 100 uniformly placed EDs. The delay in case of \u201cdelay before transmit\u201d is calculated using the following equation: TD = (EDID \u00d7 Ud) mod Pktiat, (7) where EDID is the ID of the respective ED, Ud is the delay in microseconds, and Pktiat is the node mean packet arrival time. For these experiments, Ud was set to 1000. Fig. 5 shows the observed performance. Only a minor difference in performance can be seen as all the features of these MAC protocols are already present in LoRaDRL. Furthermore, LoRaDRL reduces the burden on ordinary nodes by pushing the complexity to a central entity (the gateway). The performance of LoRaSim with different MAC protocols has been shown in."

We have provided a detailed performance evaluation of this proposed algorithm by testing it in LoRa networks consisting of LoRa enddevices (EDs) having different mobility velocities, and in dense LoRa deployments. Our scheme has shown exceptional results when compared with similar previous techniques. Furthermore, we have proposed a multichannel scheme for LoRaDRL to support multiple channels. We tested the performance of LoRaDRL with different MAC protocols and show its ability to manage the system while shifting the complexity from the EDs to the gateway. We have also tested our proposed technique under large-scale jamming attacks where the rule-based techniques fail badly. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed technique against such attacks and its adaptiveness to the changes in the environment."
